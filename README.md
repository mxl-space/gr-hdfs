# gr-hdfs

gr-hdfs is an Out-Of-Tree (OOT) GNU Radio module designed to enable seamless interaction with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It provides two custom blocks:

1. **HDFS Sink**: Functions similarly to the built-in File Sink block but writes data to HDFS.
2. **HDFS Source**: Functions similarly to the built-in File Source block but reads data from HDFS.

This module simplifies working with HDFS within the GNU Radio framework, enabling new possibilities for integrating big data processing pipelines.

## Features

- **HDFS Sink**: Stream data directly from GNU Radio to HDFS.
- **HDFS Source**: Retrieve data from HDFS into GNU Radio workflows.
- Compatible with GNU Radio and configurable with Python and Conda environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GNU Radio installed on your system.
- CMake (minimum version 3.10 recommended).

### Steps

#### Standard Installation

```bash
cd gr-hdfs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

#### Installation in a Conda Environment

If using a Conda environment, specify the Python executable and CMake installation directory:

```bash
conda activate <ENV_NAME>
cd gr-hdfs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=~/miniforge3/envs/<ENV_NAME>/bin/python -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/miniforge3/envs/<ENV_NAME>
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

Replace `<ENV_NAME>` with the name of your Conda environment.

## Usage

Once installed, the `HDFS Sink` and `HDFS Source` blocks will appear in your GNU Radio Companion (GRC) block library. You can use them like any other blocks in your flowgraph. Configure the HDFS file paths and other parameters in the block properties.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example use case:

1. **HDFS Sink**: Save data from a signal source to an HDFS file.

   - Configure the block with the desired HDFS path (e.g., `hdfs://<namenode>:<port>/path/to/file`).

2. **HDFS Source**: Read the saved data from HDFS and process it in GNU Radio.
